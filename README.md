# Omniauth Delivery

This is what I believe is the real Omniauth-delivery gem (even though someone snatched the omniauth-delivery gem before I could get it). I haven't added the sandbox URLs yet (feel free to make a pull request for that).

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'omniauth-delivery.com'

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install omniauth-delivery.com
